# Data Structures and Algorithms – Lab Programs

This repository contains **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) lab programs** implemented as part of academic coursework.  

## Lab Program Mapping

### Lab 1: Application of Stack
Demonstrates the implementation and application of the **stack data structure**, including push and pop operations, and its use in solving problems that follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

### Lab 2: Queue Operations
Demonstrates **queue implementation** using arrays or linked lists, including enqueue and dequeue operations, and variations such as priority queue or double-ended queue.

### Lab 3: Searching Algorithms
Demonstrates **linear search and binary search** techniques, highlighting their working principles and time complexity differences.

### Lab 4: Sorting Algorithms
Demonstrates **Quick Sort and Merge Sort**, focusing on divide-and-conquer strategy and comparison of their efficiency.

### Lab 5: Topological Sorting
Demonstrates **topological sort** on a directed acyclic graph (DAG), illustrating dependency resolution using graph traversal techniques.

### Lab 6: Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees
Demonstrates implementation of **self-balancing binary search trees** (such as AVL trees) and compares their performance with normal BST operations.

### Lab 7: Shortest Path
**Dijkstra’s Algorithm** for shortest path computation (simple or priority queue based), or  

### Lab 8: Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication
Demonstrates **Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication Algorithm**, showcasing divide-and-conquer optimization over traditional matrix multiplication.

### Lab 9: Travelling Salesman Problem
Demonstrates a solution to the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using **dynamic programming**, emphasizing optimization and computational complexity.

## Purpose of This Repository
- To demonstrate practical implementation of **core DSA concepts**
- To analyze **time and space complexity** of algorithms
- To strengthen algorithmic thinking and structured problem-solving
- To serve as a reference for **laboratory exams, theory exams, and technical interviews**

This repository is maintained strictly for academic and learning purposes.
